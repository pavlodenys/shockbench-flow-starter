Every week of an episode you decide how much of each good to send along each route of a network: fuel to power grids,
wafers to chip factories, chips to markets. Before the episode starts, random disruptions are drawn: a strait closes, a
route is sanctioned, a tariff jumps, a factory goes down. You see the network as it is this week, your stock, a demand
forecast, and noisy early warnings. An episode costs money (freight, tariffs, storage, unmet demand). Lower is better.

Your **score** compares your cost with two references on the same scenarios: **0** is the naive rule (keep shipping
the normal plan), **1** is the clairvoyant plan (it knew every disruption in advance). Below 0 is worse than naive. You
do not need to know supply chains: treat it as a regular gym task and try RL, control, search or evolved policies.

## Installation and usage

### 1. Install uv

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installs Python and this project's packages, in place of pip and venv:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

For alternatives (Windows, Homebrew, pip), see [Installing uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
You also need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### 2. Fork and clone the repository

Fork this repository on GitHub (the **Fork** button), then clone your fork:

```bash
git clone <your fork's URL> shockbench-flow-starter
cd shockbench-flow-starter
```

### 3. Create and activate the virtual environment

```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows, activate with `.venv\Scripts\activate`. `uv sync` downloads Python 3.13 if you do not have it, and installs
the exact package versions of `uv.lock` into `.venv/`. For the PPO example, run `uv sync --extra rl` instead: it adds
Stable-Baselines3 and PyTorch.

The commands below assume the environment is active. Without it, put `uv run` in front: `uv run sbf evaluate mine`.

#### Windows: run evaluation in Docker

`shockbench-flow==0.1.2` imports the Unix-only `fcntl` and `termios` modules in its evaluation runner.
Native Windows `sbf evaluate` therefore fails before playing an episode. With Docker Desktop running Linux
containers, use this launcher from PowerShell in the repository:

```powershell
.\scripts\sbf-docker.ps1 evaluate mine --quick
.\scripts\sbf-docker.ps1 evaluate mine
.\scripts\sbf-docker.ps1 compare mine template --task=small
.\scripts\sbf-docker.ps1 check mine --task=small
```

The first command builds a Linux Python 3.13 environment from `uv.lock`. Later builds reuse dependency layers and
the download cache. The repository is mounted live, so agent edits apply immediately and outputs stay on Windows.
Linux dependencies live in `/opt/venv`; the Windows `.venv` is not used. Reference calculations persist in the Docker
volume `shockbench-flow-reference-cache`. Use agent names or repository-relative paths in these commands.
The image includes the core and test dependencies; the optional PPO dependencies are not installed.
`--quick` is only a smoke test; omit it for the normal evaluation. This launcher does not expose the Docker engine
inside the container, so use `check` without the nested `--docker` option.

### 4. Run the quick start

```bash
python examples/01_quickstart.py
```

It plays one episode of the practice network (Tiny) with random actions and prints the cost. The first run is slow
while Python compiles the packages.

### 5. Create your agent

This checkout includes an inventory-aware fuel policy in `agents/mine` and a preserved `agents/baseline`.
See [the strategy and measured results](docs/MINE.md) before replacing `mine` with the template below.

```bash
cp -r agents/template agents/mine
```

Then edit `act()` in `agents/mine/agent.py`. An agent is one class:

```python
import numpy as np

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, config=None):   # once per episode
        u0 = config["static"]["edges"]["u0"]
        self.cap = np.array([u0[e] for e in config["static"]["action_slots"]["edge"]])

    def act(self, observation):        # once per week
        return {"flows": self.cap * observation["action_mask"]}  # send the maximum on every allowed route
```

On the server, `agent.py` may only import Python's standard library, numpy, SciPy and PyTorch (CPU). Put the files it
loads (weights, tables) in its folder.

### 6. Score it

```bash
sbf evaluate mine                # your score on Tiny's 20 dev episodes, with a 90 % interval
sbf compare mine template        # did your change help? a paired interval
```

The first run on a network computes the reference costs and caches them: about a minute on Tiny, longer on Small and
Full. When your agent works on Tiny, add `--task=small`: Small is the network the public board scores.

### 7. Check and submit

Register for the competition on Codabench and wait for the organisers' approval. Then:

```bash
sbf check mine --task=small      # the server's checks and a timed run
cp .env.example .env             # then set CODABENCH_COMPETITION in .env to the competition's URL
sbf token                        # once: asks for your Codabench login and saves your API token in .env
sbf upload mine --dry_run        # checks everything, uploads nothing
sbf upload mine --wait           # submits, then waits for the score
```

- Each upload uses one of your 3 daily submissions. `sbf upload` never retries.
- `sbf token` exists because Codabench's pages do not show your API token. An account made with "Sign in with
  GitHub" needs a password first (Codabench's password reset).
- `sbf upload` uses Codabench's undocumented web API, which may change. The competition page always works: upload
  `outputs/mine.zip`, which `sbf pack mine` writes.

## The task

| Environment           | Role                            | Nodes | Edges | Goods | Straits | Weeks | `flows` slots |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- | ----- | ------------- |
| `ShockBench/Tiny-v0`  | practice, the default           | 12    | 25    | 4     | 1       | 26    | 20            |
| `ShockBench/Small-v0` | **the public board**            | 38    | 115   | 8     | 7       | 52    | 108           |
| `ShockBench/Full-v0`  | **the private board**           | 72    | 369   | 8     | 7       | 104   | 395           |

- **Action**, a dict of arrays: `flows` (how much to send on each route this week, 0 or more), and optionally
  `override_qty` and `release_mode` (how tankers queued at a strait leave: 0 the default rule, 1 your quantities,
  2 hold).
- **Observation**, a dict of arrays keyed by name: stock, backlog, goods in transit, the network this week (capacity,
  cost, lead time, sanctions and tariffs, how open each strait is), last week's costs, the demand forecast, warnings
  and announcements. Each field `x` has a mask `x.observed`; `action_mask` marks the routes you may use this week.
- **Reward**: minus the week's cost in USD. Weeks cost millions to billions, so for RL use the `ScaleReward` wrapper.

Read every shape from the agent's `config`: the networks differ in size. [docs/GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md) has the
details, and [docs/fields/](docs/fields/) lists every field of each network.

## Commands

| Command                | What it does                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sbf evaluate <agent>` | Your score on the dev episodes, its 90 % interval, the costs in USD, and the weeks the naive rule played for you.   |
| `sbf compare <a> <b>`  | Both agents on the same episodes. If the interval of the difference holds 0, the episodes cannot tell them apart. |
| `sbf check <agent>`    | The server's zip checks, every file's imports, and a timed run with only the server's packages (`--docker`: in a local copy of the scoring container). |
| `sbf pack <agent>`     | Writes `outputs/<name>.zip`, for the competition page's upload button.                                             |
| `sbf token`            | Gets your Codabench API token from your login and saves it in `.env`.                                              |
| `sbf upload <agent>`   | Packs the agent and submits it (`--dry_run` to rehearse, `--wait` for the score).                                   |
| `sbf status [id]`      | Your submissions and their scores.                                                                                  |

`<agent>` is a name (`mine` means `agents/mine/`), a folder or a zip. Every command takes `--task=tiny|small|full`
(default `tiny`); `sbf <command> --help` lists the rest. `--quick` gives a rough score in seconds (not the board's
numbers). To switch a flag off, write `--noquick` or `--quick=False`: lowercase `--quick=false` counts as on.

## Examples

Each example is one file: read it, copy it, change it. They run on Tiny by default and take flags like `sbf`
(`--help` lists them). Files they write go to `outputs/<example>/<date_time>/`. An agent that 05 trains or 06 searches
fits only the network it was made on: use `--task=small` for one you will submit.

## Glossary

- **Naive rule** (score 0): keep shipping the normal plan and ignore disruptions. A week your agent cannot play (an
  exception, a malformed action, over the CPU budget) is played by the naive rule instead.
- **Clairvoyant plan** (score 1; "the oracle" in the package's code): a linear program that knows the whole scenario in
  advance. No agent can beat it on average.
- **Score** ("RSS" in the package and on the board): the share of the saving from naive to the clairvoyant plan that
  your agent achieves.
- **Harm level** (1 calmest to 4 most harmful): how much damage an episode's disruptions would do. The board weights
  them 50 %, 30 %, 15 %, 5 %.
- **Dev split**: the 20 public episodes `sbf evaluate` uses by default. The boards score private episodes drawn the
  same way.
- **Root** (`entropy`): the seed of a set of scenarios. 0 is the dev split's; any other integer gives scenarios of your
  own to train on.

## Rules

The rules that decide a score (the server's packages, CPU budgets, seeding, size limits, the boards, submission limits)
are in [docs/GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md#rules). The dates are on the competition page.

## Layout

It is your fork: change anything.

```
agents/            one folder per agent: template (send the maximum), random, heuristic, and yours
examples/          01_quickstart.py ... 07_dashboard.py, and ppo_agent.py (the PPO submission's agent.py)
src/sbf_starter/   the `sbf` command line
docs/              GUIDE.md (interface, rules, scoring) and fields/ (every observation and action field)
scripts/           fields_docs.py: regenerates docs/fields/ after a new shockbench-flow release
tests/             pytest -n 3
outputs/           run folders and zips (gitignored)
```

The benchmark itself is the [`shockbench-flow`](https://pypi.org/project/shockbench-flow/) package from PyPI.
Add a package with `uv add <package>`; `agent.py` still may only import the server's packages.
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the same map for a coding assistant.

## Updating

`pyproject.toml` asks for `shockbench-flow >= 0.1.2`; `uv.lock` records the exact version everyone installs. Update
with uv, never by editing a version:

```bash
uv tree --outdated --depth 1                  # is there a newer shockbench-flow? it shows "(latest: ...)"
uv sync --upgrade-package shockbench-flow     # install the newest one; your other packages stay as locked
```

Add `--extra rl` to `uv sync` if you use PPO: without it, uv removes Stable-Baselines3 and PyTorch. Commit the
changed `uv.lock`. Fixes to the kit itself come from this repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream <this repository's URL>    # once
git pull upstream main
uv sync
```

If `uv.lock` conflicts because you added packages, take the new lock and relock:
`git checkout --theirs uv.lock && uv lock && uv sync`.

## FAQ

**Do I need to know supply chains or RL?** No. It is an episodic control problem with a dict observation and a dict
action. A good first step is to beat the template on Small.

**Which network is scored?** The public board plays Small, the private board Full ([docs/GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md#rules)).

**How do I avoid overfitting the 20 dev episodes?** Train and tune on your own root
(`sbf evaluate mine --entropy=12345 --episodes=64`, or `gym.make(..., entropy=12345)`), and confirm on the dev
episodes with `sbf compare`.

**`sbf: command not found`.** Activate the environment (step 3), or put `uv run` in front. If you moved or renamed
the folder after `uv sync`, the environment still points at the old path: recreate it with
`deactivate; rm -rf .venv && uv sync && source .venv/bin/activate`.

**My agent crashes on Small but not on Tiny.** Read shapes from `config["spaces"]`. On Small and Full the queue at the
straits is one dense table (`queue_lots.qty`); Tiny's per-lot lists do not exist there
([docs/GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md#small-and-full)).

**Where do I ask questions?** On the competition's forum.
